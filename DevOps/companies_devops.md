### **DevOps Phases** Explained:
- **Source Control**: Managing code repositories (e.g., GitLab).  
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)**: Automating the building, testing, and deploying of code (e.g., AWS DevOps, GitLab, Semaphore).  
- **Configuration Management**: Automating infrastructure configuration and provisioning (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack).  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing cloud infrastructure through code (e.g., HashiCorp, DuploCloud).  
- **Security**: Automating security practices and vulnerability scanning (e.g., HashiCorp, StackHawk, SaltStack).  
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Tracking application and infrastructure performance (e.g., Honeycomb).  
- **Artifact Management**: Storing and managing software packages (e.g., JFrog).
